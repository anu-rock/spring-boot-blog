# tldr;
This is my first web project based on Spring Boot. It uses Hibernate for ORM and MySQL for database.  
The 'funnest' part is the language it's coded in: Kotlin rather than plain old Java.  
Seriously, you should try out Kotlin if you haven't already. If you like Java and JavaScript, you will love Kotlin!

# Did I create this application all by myself?
Nope. I had help. I followed this beautiful tutorial (you should too):  
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/

# How to open it?
1. Clone this repo.
2. Then, open the cloned directory in Intellij IDEA.
3. Let gradle sync complete to install all dependencies.
4. Poof, you're done.

# How to use it?
1. Run the app by right-clicking BlogApplication.kt and selecting 'Run...'. The app will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
2. Run the tests by right-clicking 'test' folder and selecting 'Run All Tests'.
3. Use something like Postman to test the API endpoints.
